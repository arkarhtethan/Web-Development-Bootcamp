Generic Notes
- HTML files - Structure of your website (builders)
- CSS files - stylesheet of your website (painters)
- javascript files - functionality of your website (electricians / plumbers)
- Wireframe (low fidelity, just sketches of what your website might look like http://sneakpeekit.com/, https://balsamiq.cloud/ - paid)
- mockup (high fidelity, going into the future and taking a screenshot of your website)
- Look at some websites for inspiration then go to http://www.ui-patterns.com to look for


HTML Notes
- HTML file is the structure, you can make a website just with HTML code (though it might be plain)
- Hypertext markup language.
- specify layout and structure using html tags.
- codepen.io (no sign ups required)
- h1 to h6. How you know limit is at 6? Documentation. Read the html documentation.

- https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/
- UTF-8 rocks

- Identation helps with readability
- one tag can have 1 id but multiple classes
- designing websites are like completing a puzzle with each piece being a different sized block.

Syntax of html tags
<start tag>content<closing tag> e.g. <h1>Hello world!</br>
<self closing tag> e.g. <br>, <hr> (horizontal rule)
<element attribute=""> e.g. <hr size="3" noshade>

- https://giphy.com/stickers (stickers come with transparent background)
- spans are like divs, they don't do very much unless used in conjection with CSS
- absolute position means relative to the parent's position (usually the page or the div the element is in).
- Note that your parent needs to have the position of relative otherwise it'll take the next parent which has it (usually the page)
- relative position means relative position from it's original position
- fixed position means fixed to the screen like a frozen header row in a table.
- when using inline display, you cannot specify the width and height
- if you change the width or height of blocks and you try to do text-align, it will fail. You should resort to using margin: auto.
- text-align: center should be used inside parent css.

- https://bootsnipp.com (snippets of code)
- things that come first in HTML will be at the back (in terms of z-index), needs the position property.
- inline style sheet > external style sheet (id > class > html tag) for css priority but avoid internal style sheets

Syntax of CSS
selector (i.e. tag) = who to change?
property = what to change
value = how to change?
selector {property: value;}

Media queries
@media <type> <feature>

Javascript Notes
- Inside the javscript console, under sources, find the snippets tab. In this tab you can easily write javascript code and run it as opposed to trying to write it in the console.
- document.querySelector works for html tags, classes (.className) and ids (#idName)
- can also combine multiple selectors in querySelector with space e.g. if you wanted a "a" tag inside the "li" tag, you can do document.querySelector("li a")
- similarly, if you wanted a li with a particular class, you can do document.querySelector("li.className")
- querySelector only returns the first element that matches the selector.
- querySelectorAll if you want multiple elements
- getElement(s)By[Id,Class,Tag etc.]
- https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp
- values in javascript have to be specified in string e.g. "10rem", "red"
- innerHtml gives you all inside the tag including other HTML tags.
- textContent only gives you the text.
- attributes, getAttribute() and setAttribute()
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
- anonymous function has no function name.
- sometimes if you passing function as callback, you just need to pass the name. If you add the parenthesis, it will be called when your code is run.
- Javascript has a debugger function. Put it before the function being called "debugger;"
- use classlist to add new class.
- figure out the differences between innerHTML, innerText, textContent (http://perfectionkills.com/the-poor-misunderstood-innerText/)

JQuery Notes
- $ in jQuery = document.querySelector
- if you're going to use jquery inside your js file, you need to put your js scriptsrc b4 the js file otherwise it won't be able to understand stuff like $.
- if jquery src is in title with index.js, it might load the index.js first and not prompt an error so the way you fix it is by using $(document).ready(function(){ enter code here })
- you can avoid the problem above by simply putting the scriptsrc before the closing body tag.
- minifier.org
- shouldn't be changing css or adding new html tag inside javascript. Maybe you can use a custom class that you can toggle on and off if you want to change the css.

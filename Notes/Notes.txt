- Identation helps with readability

- designing websites are like completing a puzzle with each piece being a different sized block.

- spans are like divs, they don't do very much unless used in conjection with CSS
- absolute position means relative to the parent's position (usually the page or the div the element is in).
- Note that your parent needs to have the position of relative otherwise it'll take the next parent which has it (usually the page)
- relative position means relative position from it's original position
- fixed position means fixed to the screen like a frozen header row in a table.
- when using inline display, you cannot specify the width and height
- if you change the width or height of blocks and you try to do text-align, it will fail. You should resort to using margin: auto.
- text-align: center should be used inside parent css.



Syntax of CSS
selector (i.e. tag) = who to change?
property = what to change
value = how to change?
selector {property: value;}

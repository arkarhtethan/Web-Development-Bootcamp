Generic Notes
- HTML files - Structure of your website (builders)
- CSS files - stylesheet of your website (painters)
- javascript files - functionality of your website (electricians / plumbers)
- Wireframe (low fidelity, just sketches of what your website might look like http://sneakpeekit.com/, https://balsamiq.cloud/ - paid)
- mockup (high fidelity, going into the future and taking a screenshot of your website)
- Look at some websites for inspiration then go to http://www.ui-patterns.com to look for


HTML Notes
- HTML file is the structure, you can make a website just with HTML code (though it might be plain)
- Hypertext markup language.
- specify layout and structure using html tags.
- codepen.io (no sign ups required)
- h1 to h6. How you know limit is at 6? Documentation. Read the html documentation.

- Identation helps with readability
- one tag can have 1 id but multiple classes
- designing websites are like completing a puzzle with each piece being a different sized block.

Syntax of html tags
<start tag>content<closing tag> e.g. <h1>Hello world!</br>
<self closing tag> e.g. <br>, <hr> (horizontal rule)
<element attribute=""> e.g. <hr size="3" noshade>

- spans are like divs, they don't do very much unless used in conjection with CSS
- absolute position means relative to the parent's position (usually the page or the div the element is in).
- Note that your parent needs to have the position of relative otherwise it'll take the next parent which has it (usually the page)
- relative position means relative position from it's original position
- fixed position means fixed to the screen like a frozen header row in a table.
- when using inline display, you cannot specify the width and height
- if you change the width or height of blocks and you try to do text-align, it will fail. You should resort to using margin: auto.
- text-align: center should be used inside parent css.

- things that come first in HTML will be at the back (in terms of z-index), needs the position property.
- inline style sheet > external style sheet (id > class > html tag) for css priority but avoid internal style sheets

Syntax of CSS
selector (i.e. tag) = who to change?
property = what to change
value = how to change?
selector {property: value;}

Media queries
@media <type> <feature>

Javascript Notes
- Inside the javscript console, under sources, find the snippets tab. In this tab you can easily write javascript code and run it as opposed to trying to write it in the console.
- document.querySelector works for html tags, classes (.className) and ids (#idName)
- can also combine multiple selectors in querySelector with space e.g. if you wanted a "a" tag inside the "li" tag, you can do document.querySelector("li a")
- similarly, if you wanted a li with a particular class, you can do document.querySelector("li.className")
- querySelector only returns the first element that matches the selector.
- querySelectorAll if you want multiple elements
- getElement(s)By[Id,Class,Tag etc.]
- https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp
- values in javascript have to be specified in string e.g. "10rem", "red"
- innerHtml gives you all inside the tag including other HTML tags.
- textContent only gives you the text.
- attributes, getAttribute() and setAttribute()
